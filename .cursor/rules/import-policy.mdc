# Import Policy for Route Pages/Components

- Prefer imports from the routeâ€‘local `ui` library: `src/app/<route>/ui/*`.
- Do not import from `@/components/ui/*` inside route files unless you are creating a new local wrapper in `ui/`.
- If a local wrapper is missing, add it in `src/app/<route>/ui/` by composing the base primitive and apply route theme classes.

Correct (within `src/app/v3/...`):

```tsx
import { Button } from "../ui/button";
```

Incorrect:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"; // violates route isolation
```
